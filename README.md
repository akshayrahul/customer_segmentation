This repository contains code and resources for the Airline Customer Segmentation project.

## Project Overview

The Airline Customer Segmentation project aims to analyze customer data in the airline industry to identify distinct customer segments. By dividing customers into meaningful groups, the project aims to gain insights into customer behavior, preferences, and characteristics. This information can help airlines tailor their marketing strategies, enhance customer satisfaction, and optimize business operations.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset that includes relevant information about airline customers. The dataset may consist of various attributes, such as demographics, booking history, flight preferences, loyalty program information, and other customer-related data. Prior to analysis, the dataset is explored, cleaned, and preprocessed to ensure data quality and reliability.

## Methodology

The customer segmentation analysis involves the following steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: Data preprocessing techniques are employed to clean the dataset, handle missing values, and transform variables as necessary. Exploratory data analysis is conducted to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics and identify any patterns or outliers.

2. **Feature Engineering**: Relevant features are extracted or created from the dataset to capture customer behaviors, preferences, or characteristics that are crucial for segmentation analysis. This step may involve transforming and encoding variables, creating customer segments based on booking history, loyalty program usage, or other criteria.

3. **Customer Segmentation**: Clustering algorithms, such as k-means, hierarchical clustering, or other techniques, are applied to group customers into distinct segments. These segments are formed based on similarities in their characteristics, behaviors, or preferences.

4. **Segment Analysis**: The characteristics and behaviors of each customer segment are explored and analyzed to gain actionable insights. This analysis may involve identifying key features that differentiate segments, understanding segment preferences, and determining strategies to target each segment effectively.
